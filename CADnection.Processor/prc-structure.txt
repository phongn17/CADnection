- Model File Data (m_bUnitFromCAD, m_dUnit: actual unit)
    is the root PRC entity, represented by A3DAsmModelFile. There is only one model file per assembly tree. 
    The model file structure contains references to the product occurrences as well as global information such as the unit scale and the modelling system used 
    to create the file
    - RootBaseData
    - AsmProductOccurenceData(n) (Product Occurences: m_uiPOccurrencesSize product occurrences) is meant to encapsulate a single part, an assembly of parts, or both.
        is a logical group of geometric information. These nodes are the building blocks of the PRC assembly tree and represent the root data structure for 
        an assembly and all the information contained within. A product occurrence node may contain many child product occurrences, entity references, annotations, filters, 
        and other entities, or it could represent just a single part. It can also be used to instance other geometry by referencing other product occurrences
        - RootBaseData
            contains fields such as attributes, entity name, and ID. 
        | RootBaseWithGraphicsData (GraphicsData)
            encapsulates information that affects the appearance of the entity, such as color, line pattern, and display style.

        - Prototype
            model creators will have a need to instance the same geometric data multiple times in the model file. Most file formats will define this data once 
            and instance it wherever it is needed. It is a pointer to another product occurrence which contains geometry meant to be instanced in multiple places.
            If you find a product occurrence with neither children nor a part definition, the node likely has a reference to a prototype.

        - ExternalData (Externals)
          An external is a subassembly tree that has been created in a different CAD system than its parent file. Externals are represented by a product 
          occurrence node. The concept is similar to a prototype, and thus they should be parsed the same way. The one important difference between the two 
          is an external's geometry and attributes cannot be modified due to limitations between their disparate authoring systems.

            Product occurrences are the only type of node that may contain a part definition. A product occurrence may only contain a single part definition.
